# Arithmetic Logic Unit Design

* ALU circuit designed in VHDL using Quartus II using a given set of operations the circuit must perform using a 3-bit input to choose an operation to perfrom on two 4-bit inputs
* The circuit structure was developed by deriving Boolean equations from the truth tables for each
operation, simplifying the structure and then implementing on an FPGA board with switches and
LEDS
