# Finite State Machine Design

* A finite state machine designed in VHDL using Quartus II that lights up an LED when it detects
specific sequences
* Developed design for FSM using finite state diagrams, next state tables and Boolean
equations to create the sequence of logic gates needed, which was then implemented on an
FPGA board with switches, buttons and LEDS
